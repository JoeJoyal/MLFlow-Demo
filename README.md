**History of MLFlow**

MLflow was launched in `2018` and has grown in popularity, reaching `10 million` users in Novemner `2022`. It's lightweight and can run on an average-priced machine, but it also integrates with more complex tools.

**Purpose of MLflow**
MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

It has the following primary components:-
- Tracking : Allows you to track experiments to record and compare parameters and results.

MLflow is organized into four components: `Tracking`, `Projects`, `Models` and `Model Registry`.

**Difference between Tensorflow and MLFlow**
Model Packaging: `MLFlow provides a generic way to package ML models, whereas TFX uses TensorFlow Serving for serving TensorFlow models`.

Pipeline Components: TFX offers a suite of pipeline components specifically designed for TensorFlow, while MLFlow is more flexible and can work with various ML frameworks.

**Difference between MLOps and MLflow**

MLOps: MLOps is a broader concept that encompasses the `entire machine learning lifecycle in production`.

MLflow: MLflow is a tool that specifically aids in the `development` and `experimentation` stages by providing tools for `tracking`, `packaging` and `managing` machine learning code and models.
